##### Filling grid may be suicidal for armageddon-like simulations
simulations on the cloud confirm that it is.

##### We implement a serial version of the tiling procedure in order to not fill the GPU mem
- [x] implement the serial version of the tiling procedure
- [x] run it on the cloud -> tiles are all around $50\%$ transmission.
- [x] check $t_f$ -> it was all a matter of transforming the initial state

##### 3/07/2023
- [x] check tile by tile the "strange collapse" of the  3D GPE
- [x] design the values of velocity to find the critical barrier strength.
- [ ] launch lines simulations.
How can we interpret the results of the 3D GPE and high nonlinearity?

##### Implement dynamic time_steps assignment for better quality tiles and lines
