# CondensateDynamics.jl dev notes
 We focus on obtaining
 - [ ] ground states
[[dev_notes/ground_states]]
 - [ ] tiles for the dynamics
[[dev_notes/tiles]]
 - [ ] sigma 2
[[dev_notes/sigma2]]
# June 2023: Major refactoring
We changed radically the workflow, using scripts as standalone units in which we import CondensateDynamics
_NB: what equation are we actually simulating? We should [ ] write it down_
